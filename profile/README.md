# Digital Porous Media
---

Welcome to the Digital Porous Media Github homepage! We are a research group at The University of Texas at Austin that focuses on digital porous media physics. The group has developed sets of tools to help characterize micro-scale porous media images and to analyze simulation results.

Our tools are completely open-source and standalone, but they have been designed to integrate well with [Digital Rocks Portal](https://www.digitalrocksportal.org) data.
